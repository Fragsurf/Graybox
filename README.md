## What is this?

Graybox is a modern hammer-like level editor built for [Fragsurf](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1033410/Fragsurf/) & [AIRACCEL](https://github.com/fragsurf/airaccel).

Additionally, it is a minimal game engine built mostly for testing and internal purposes.  Graybox.Bunnyhop is a game project with example usage.

## Can I use it for my game?

Yes, but it's not user-friendly yet.  The format is simple and easy, but there is no documentation or way of describing your game's entities. Currently, it's a static file created for Fragsurf, i.e. `Graybox.Bunnyhop/Assets/Entities/Deathmatch.json`

I won't provide direct support as my time is limited.  Documentation will eventually be created to explain everything.

## Roadmap

The roadmap will be posted later.

## Early Development

Graybox is a fork of CBRE-EX, a fork of CBRE, a fork of Sledge.  It's been rewritten from the ground up, and it's very early in development. Many things will change, and many things aren't as good as they could be.
