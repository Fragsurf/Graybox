## What is this?

Graybox is a modern hammer-like level editor built for [Fragsurf](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1033410/Fragsurf/) & [AIRACCEL](https://github.com/fragsurf/airaccel).

Additionally, it is a minimal game engine built mostly for testing and internal purposes.  Graybox.Bunnyhop is a game project with example usage.

## What else?

Bunnyhop and surf have thrived for a very long time thanks to the passion of its community.  We want to continue that, and give creators the tools they need to build awesome maps.

## Roadmap

Roadmap will be posted later.

## Early Development

Graybox is a fork of CBRE-EX, which is a fork of CBRE, which is a fork of Sledge.  It's been mostly rewritten from the ground up, it's very early in development, many things will change, and many things aren't as good as they could be.
