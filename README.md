## What is this?

Graybox is a modern hammer-like level editor built for (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1033410/Fragsurf/)[Fragsurf] & (https://github.com/fragsurf/airaccel)[AIRACCEL].

Additionally, it is a minimal game engine built mostly for testing and internal purposes.  Graybox.Bunnyhop is a game project with example usage.

## What else?

Bunnyhop and surf have thrived for a very long time thanks to the passion of its community.  We want to continue that, and give creators the tools they need to build awesome maps.
